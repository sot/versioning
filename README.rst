Version numbering template.

This package is not intended to be installed, but rather to serve as a template to be
copied into a project and provide version information, including git version values.  It
is copied instead of used as a module to ensure that projects can always run their
setup.py with no external dependency.

See ``versioning/version.py`` for usage instructions.
